# Personal Portfolio

## Description

This is an online portfolio of my latest work. I was challenged to apply my most recent HTML and CSS teachings to create a responsive portfolio showcasing the things I'm learning during the UTSA Boot Camp. I wanted to take the opportunity to create a solid foundation that I can continuously update throughout the program. Over the course of the project, I was able to become much more acclimated to applying media queries in CSS, as well as utilitizing flex to ensure a responsive layout.

## Usage

This site is to be used as an online portfolio, demonstrating my latest projects, as well as providing link to where I can be contacted professionally.

## Credits

I received assistance from the 2U Tutor program during the course of this project, as well as TA assistance from the UTSA Boot Camp.
